# SEA D&D

A basic setup with Browsersync and Nodemon can be found here. Nothing else really at the moment :P

run `npm install` and `bower install` to grab all necessary dependencies, then run `gulp`. This will automatically compile all Sass/JS, setup Browsersync and Nodemon, and auto-refresh your browser as any relevant files change.

Some basic API Endpoints that I copied from somewhere can be found under `./routes/api.js`. If you look at `./index.js` at the Root you'll see how those are called.
